3. Deletion – Removing an element

From the end


4. Searching – Finding an element

Linear Search (checks one-by-one)

Binary Search (only works on sorted arrays):

Iterative method

Recursive method


5. Sorting – Arranging elements in order (ascending/descending)

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort
